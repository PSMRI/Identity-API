Identity API is a microservice which is used for the creation and management of beneficaries.

### Primary Features
* Beneficiary Creation
* Beneficiary Search
* Beneficiary Management


## Environment and setup
For setting up the development environment, please refer to the [Developer Guide](https://piramal-swasthya.gitbook.io/amrit/developer-guide/development-environment-setup) .

# Running Instructions

This service consists of two profiles that work together: the main application profile and the 1097_identity profile. Each profile operates on a different port for independent functionality.

## Building and Running

### 1. Main Application (Port: 8094)
```bash
# Build and Run
mvn clean install -DENV_VAR=local
mvn spring-boot:run -DENV_VAR=local
```

### 2. 1097_identity Profile (Port: 8095)
```bash
# Build and Run (in a new terminal)
mvn clean install -P1097_identity -DENV_VAR=local
mvn spring-boot:run -P1097_identity -DENV_VAR=local
```

**Note:** Start the main application before running the 1097_identity profile. Each profile requires the `-DENV_VAR=local` parameter for local development.
